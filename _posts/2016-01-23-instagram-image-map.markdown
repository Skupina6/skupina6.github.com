Application is used to display images from Instagram and display their location on the map. There are picture thumbnails on the map, which represent picture. By clicling on the marker, you can see bigger picture and its bio. You can also see links to a location. Clicking on a image takes you to Instagram post.

##  Technical details
Application is built using Python (Django) and Leaflet (Open Street map). I also use Marker clustering for Leaflet.

*Disclaimer: I do not own the media. Instagram is the owner.*
