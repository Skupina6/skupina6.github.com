    project_title: Instagram image map
    project_description: >-
      Application is used to display images from Instagram and display their location on the map. There are picture thumbnails on the map, which represent picture. By clicling on the marker, you can see bigger picture and its bio. You can also see links to a location. Clicking on a image takes you to Instagram post.



      **Technical details**


      Application is built using Python (Django) and Leaflet (Open Street map). I also use Marker clustering for Leaflet.


      *Disclaimer: I do not own the media. Instagram is the owner.*

  - project_title: Apartment phone number scraper
    project_description: >-
      When I was looking for an apartment, I found a lot of appropriate housings. The problem was that ads for those housings did not have all the details, so I had to call owners.


      The problem is that it becomes confusing when you have a large number of contacts. You dont know which number belongs to which housing owener.

      
      So I was thinking about this problem, and I said: Wouldnt be cool if I alreads had those contacts linked with ads? So the idea for this app was born.


      This application does not have UI, it is a scheduled application. Developer defines url where the scraping wil commence, and selectors for apartment title, description, and phone number. When run, application will scrape those parameters and add them in Google Contacts.



      This application was initially meant for [nepremicnine.net](https://www.nepremicnine.net/). However, the best thing is that this scraper can also be used for other things, like scraping car or phone advertisements (on a webpages like auto.net or bolha.com). You only need to change data selectors.


      **Techincal details**

      
      Application is built using Python (Django), APScheduler and Google Python libary.
